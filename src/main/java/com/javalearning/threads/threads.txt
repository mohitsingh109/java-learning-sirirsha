Two Ways to create Thread

1) Extend the Thread class
2) Implementing Runnable interface

1) Object Level Locking
    (Synchronized Method), (Synchronized block)

2) Class Level Locking
    (Synchronized Class Function), (Synchronized block)

Thread Communication:
wait(), notify(), notifyAll()

wait() --> waiting for a resource
notify() --> notify only one thread
notifyAll() --> notify all the thread


Thread Lifecycle
1) New: Thread created but not started
2) Runnable: Thread is ready to run and waiting for CPU to schedule it
3) Running: thread is running
4) Blocked: {Code, I/O, Lock, ..} When thread is waiting for a resource
5) Terminated: Thread finish it's work, CPU Inteput, Code Terminated
