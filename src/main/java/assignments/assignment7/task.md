# Assignment: Math Functions and Algorithms in Java

**Objective:**  
The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with mathematical functions and algorithms in Java. You will implement various mathematical operations and algorithms to enhance your programming skills.

**Instructions:**

1. **Basic Math Operations**
    - Create a class named `MathOperations`.
    - In the `main` method, perform the following operations:
        1. Declare two integer variables `a` and `b`. Assign them values of your choice.
        2. Calculate and print the following:
            - The sum of `a` and `b`.
            - The difference of `a` and `b`.
            - The product of `a` and `b`.
            - The quotient of `a` divided by `b`.
            - The remainder of `a` divided by `b`.

2. **Using Math Library**
    - Utilize the `Math` library to perform the following operations:
        1. Find the square root of `a` and print the result.
        2. Calculate the power of `a` raised to `b` and print the result.
        3. Generate and print a random number between 1 and 100 using `Math.random()`.

3. **Implementing Algorithms**
    - Write a method named `factorial(int n)` that calculates the factorial of a given integer `n`. Test this method with different values and print the results.
    - Write a method named `fibonacci(int n)` that returns the `n`th Fibonacci number. Test this method with different values and print the results.

4. **Bonus Challenge**
    - Implement a method named `isPrime(int n)` that checks if a number `n` is a prime number. Test this method with several numbers and print the results.

**Submission Requirements:**
- Implement the `MathOperations` class as specified above.
- Ensure your code is well-commented to explain each section.
- Submit your Java file (.java) via the designated submission platform.
