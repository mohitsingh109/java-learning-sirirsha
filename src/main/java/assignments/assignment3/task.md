Java Inheritance Assignment:

Objective:

To understand the concepts of inheritance, function overloading, function overriding, and the use of the protected access modifier in Java.
Task:

Create a Shape Class:
    Define a Java class named Shape.
    Include attributes such as color and filled to represent the color and filled status of the shape.
    Implement constructors and methods to initialize and display shape details.
    Create Subclasses for Different Types of Shapes:

Create subclasses Circle and Rectangle that extend the Shape class.
    Add additional attributes and methods specific to circles and rectangles like radius in circle and width, height in rectangle.
    Implement constructors and methods to initialize and display details for each subclass.

Implement Constructors/Function Overloading:
    Overload the constructors of the Circle and Rectangle classes to accept different parameters.
    Demonstrate the use of function overloading by creating multiple instances of circles and rectangles using different constructors.

Implement Function Overriding:
    Override the displayDetails method in the Circle and Rectangle classes to display additional details specific to each type of shape.
    Demonstrate the use of function overriding by invoking the displayDetails method for both circle and rectangle objects.

Use of Protected Access Modifier:
    Use the protected access modifier to restrict access to certain attributes or methods in the parent Shape class.
    Demonstrate the use of the protected access modifier by accessing protected members in the subclasses Circle and Rectangle.

Create a Main Class:
    Implement a Main class with a main method to test the functionality of the Shape, Circle, and Rectangle classes.
    Create instances of circles and rectangles, initialize their attributes, and display their details using the displayDetails method.
